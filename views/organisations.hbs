            Our core belief at Town Hall is that guiding every democracy: that the government of the people be done for and by the people.
            The only way to truly enforce that tenet is through the established Fourth Estate of government. The men and women whose jobs
            it is to keep the electorate informed. The men and women that consist of your organisation.
            <br><br>
            Informing the people, as you already know, is no easy task because the questions of relevance and association come into play.
            Using the remarkable power of the Internet, Town Hall exists to connect individuals with their lawmakers, elected to represent
            their interests.
            <br><br>
            That task is near impossible without you and the journalists working for your organisation.
            With you, we can together make our democracy work for all parties involved.
            You bring the news, bucketfuls of it, and we'll provide a platform for the appropriate news to get to the appropriate audience.
            <br><br>
            Together, we can ensure that the people our democracy was created to serve get a say in the matters shaping their lives.
